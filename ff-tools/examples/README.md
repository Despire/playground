This directory contains a bunch of polyglot examples that may or may not work depending on what software version you have or what operating system you run.

The directory `lfs` contains larger files that need to be fetched with git-lfs.
The directory `linux` contains files that are specific to linux
The directory `macos` contains files that are specific to macos
The directory `platform-independent` contains files that should work anywhere.


The example were tested and are using ARM64 architecture! If you are running this on different architure this will not work (regarding the binaries)
